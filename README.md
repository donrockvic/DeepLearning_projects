# Deep Learning Projects

Repository containing a portfolio of Deep Learning projects/Assignments completed by me for academic and self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of an iPython Notebook and Python script.

You can check out my website at [My Website](https://portfoliovsevicky.herokuapp.com/).

## Content

* [Basic ANN](https://github.com/donrockvic/DeepLearning_projects/blob/master/ANN_simple/ZeroHiddenLayer.ipynb):This is a iPython notebook is one implementation of one Neural network. Here we have used zero hidden layer, so in a way this implementation is more like Logistic regression problem. We have used Sigmoid function as Activation layer.  


* [Simple ANN](https://github.com/donrockvic/DeepLearning_projects/blob/master/ANN_simple/OneHiddenLayerANN.ipynb): In this iPython notebook I have implemnted a ANN with one hidden neural network from scratch(No python framework), even though it has only one hidden layer it is giving very good output. As you can see some of the result below. One more example is there in the Notebook.

* [Deep ANN](https://github.com/donrockvic/DeepLearning_projects/blob/master/ANN_Deep/Complex_NN.ipynb): This is an scratch implementation of basic deep neural network. In the notebook you can see we have two models:
	* Two hidden layer model
	* Four hidden layer model,
We have added four hidden layer in our model,However it is doing good on training set, but not so good on new data.



*Note*
*1. Above three Projects are created as part of assignent for Coursera course [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#courses)*
*All three implemntaions are just done with python, we have used scikit-learn at one place to split train and test data*

*Tools: sci-kit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PIL, h5*


* [Car Brand Prediction](https://github.com/donrockvic/DeepLearning_projects/blob/master/Deep-Learning-Car-Brand/Transfer_Learning_Resnet_50.ipynb): Transfer learning implementaion on RESNET50 model. I have used RESNET50 because this was the first model with Residul block(Skip connection) implemention, which give very good result. <br>
Since I have trained the model with very less data, my model is not getting all the features. Is is able to done prediction with less accuraccy(My model is recognizing edge feature very well, so it will give you awesome result for Lamborghini).

I will train this model with more data and update soon.


*Tools: sci-kit-learn, Numpy, Tensorflo/Keras, Seaborn, Matplotlib,Pillow*





I also developed in all other kinds of Technology. You can find a general portfolio [here](https://github.com/donrockvic/General-development).
