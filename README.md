 # Deep Learning Projects

Repository containing a portfolio of Deep Learning projects/Assignments completed by me for academic and self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of an iPython Notebook and Python script.

You can check out my website at [My Website](https://portfoliovsevicky.herokuapp.com/).

## Content

* [Basic ANN](https://github.com/donrockvic/DeepLearning_projects/blob/master/ANN_simple/ZeroHiddenLayer.ipynb): This is an iPython notebook is one implementation of one Neural network. Here we have used zero hidden layers, so in a way, this implementation is more like a Logistic regression problem. We have used the Sigmoid function as the Activation layer. We have implemented the Cat/Non-cat image classification.


* [Simple ANN](https://github.com/donrockvic/DeepLearning_projects/blob/master/ANN_simple/OneHiddenLayerANN.ipynb): In this iPython notebook I have implemented an ANN with one hidden neural network from scratch(No python framework), even though it has only one hidden layer it is giving very good output. As you can see some of the results below.

* [Deep ANN](https://github.com/donrockvic/DeepLearning_projects/blob/master/ANN_Deep/Complex_NN.ipynb): This is a scratch implementation of basic deep neural network. In the notebook you can see we have two models:
	* Two hidden layer model
	* Four hidden layer model,
We have added four hidden layers in our model, However it is doing good on the training set, but not so good on new data.



*Note*
*1. The above three Projects are created as part of an assignment for the Coursera course [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#courses)*
*All three implementations are just done with python, we have used Scikit-learn at one place to split train and test data*

*Tools: sci-kit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PIL, h5*


* [Car Brand Prediction](https://github.com/donrockvic/DeepLearning_projects/blob/master/Deep-Learning-Car-Brand/Transfer_Learning_Resnet_50.ipynb): Transfer learning implementation on RESNET50 model. I have used RESNET50 because this was the first model with Residual block(Skip connection) implementation, which give very good result. <br>
Since I have trained the model with very little data, my model is not getting all the features. It is able to done prediction with less accuracy(My model is recognizing edge feature very well, so it will give you awesome results for Lamborghini).

I will train this model with more data and update it soon.


*Tools: sci-kit-learn, Numpy, Tensorflo/Keras, Seaborn, Matplotlib,Pillow*





I also developed in all other kinds of Technology. You can find a general portfolio [here](https://github.com/donrockvic/General-development).
